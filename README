Ashima Backslash: The Shader Toolchain

Backslash provides a suite of tools to ease the development of advanced
shader systems. Backslash 0.8 features:
 - an ESSL preprocessor to expand shader source for further analysis
 - a JSON-encapsulated shader object format with symbolic dependencies to ease linking
 - a client-side linker to assemble shader source strings for rendering
 - compile-time macro definition
 - link-time macro definition
 - source-to-source translation with accurate source locations and comments
 - runs as both a native binary and in-the-browser via js_of_ocaml

Features in the pipeline for 1.0 include:
 - preprocessor conditional expression partial evaluation
 - finer-grained name collision management through pragma directives
 - macros across translation unit boundaries
 - comment stripping
 - identifier obfuscation
 - source compression
 - an option to enable emulation of the line continuation character, \

Features in the pipeline for 1.1 include:
 - shader to JavaScript compilation
 - JavaScript shader stub auto-generation
 - OCaml shader stub auto-generation
 - ESSL type-checking
 - camlp4 quotations for easy program transforms in OCaml

Special thanks to the WebGL working group for making this possible by
allowing UTF-8 in shader comments. This is the PP dance.
