gloc: (WebGL|ESSL) gl(sl) o(bject) c(ompiler)

gloc provides a suite of tools to ease the development of advanced
shader systems. gloc 0.8 features:
 - an ESSL preprocessor to expand shader source for further analysis
 - preprocessor conditional expression partial evaluation
 - a JSON-encapsulated shader object format with symbolic dependencies to ease linking
 - a client-side linker to assemble shader source strings for rendering
 - compile-time macro definition
 - link-time macro definition
 - source-to-source translation with accurate source locations and comments
 - runs as both a native binary and in-the-browser via ocamljs
 - optional emulation of the line continuation character, \

Special thanks to the WebGL working group for making this possible by
allowing UTF8 in shader comments.
