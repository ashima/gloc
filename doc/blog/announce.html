<h1>Introducing <span class="glow">glo</span>, <span class="glow">gloc</span>,
  and <span class="glow">glol</span> for Open World Wide Web Shader Linking</h1>
<p>Hello, World Wide Web! This is David Sheets, co-founder of Ashima Arts,
  coming to you in living hypermedia.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the first release
of <a class="glow" href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/">gloc</a>, a
  precision-crafted toolkit for WebGL and OpenGL ES2 GLSL
  shaders. gloc
  enables authors to easily unlock the power and creative potential of
  3D Web and mobile graphics by making collaboration simple.</p>

<p style="font-size: 120%">
  <strong class="glow">g</strong>loc<br />
  <strong class="glow">l</strong>inks<br />
  <strong class="glow">o</strong>ur<br />
  <strong class="glow">c</strong>reativity!</p>

<p><span class="glow">gloc</span> represents a leap forward for
portable, high-performance numeric and graphics functionality by
promoting shaders and shader fragments to first-class web
resources.</p>
<h3>What <span class="glow">gloc</span> enables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Libraries of shader functions</li>
  <li>Capability-based shader component fall-backs</li>
  <li>Collaborative shading effect mash-ups</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker">LD_PRELOAD</a></strong>-like
  functionality</li>
  <li>Compression by factorization of common shader functions</li>
  <li>Semantically-linked shaders in visualization systems</li>
  <li>Cascading shaders for selective overriding</li>
  <li>User Interface effects and compositing</li>
  <li><em>and much more!</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>How <span class="glow">gloc</span> works:</h3>

<p><span class="glow">gloc</span> is a multi-stage compiler that
  accurately parses and reifies the lexical structure of the language
  tokens, the lexical preprocessor, and the shading language
  proper. Every token's position is tracked to the file, line and
  column, and comments are tagged to their nearest
  token. <span class="glow">gloc</span>'s preprocessor is first-class,
  open-scoped, and partial, which allows staged evaluation of
  preprocessor directives as environmental parameters become known.
</p>
<p>After the parsing and evaluation of the preprocessor expressions,
  <span class="glow">gloc</span> analyzes the potential shading language
  token streams for validity (grammatical only in this release, type
  checking will be added in a future
  release). <span class="glow">gloc</span>'s shading language parser is
  also open-scoped, allowing for undeclared variables, functions, and
  types. Scope analysis is then performed on the token streams; and
  finally, required and exported macros and symbols are inferred.
</p>
<p>The result of this scope analysis and a minimally modified
  reserialization of the source is then packaged into a simple JSON
  format, <a class="glow"
  href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/#glo">glo</a>. The <span class="glow">glo</span>
  format we have designed makes accurate linking as easy as possible
  with a concise linking algorithm, <a class="glow"
  href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/#glol">glol</a>. <span class="glow">glo</span>
  includes support for link maps indicating the location of each linked
  source fragment to aid debugging. Also included is optional
  hyperlinked authorship metadata declaring the copyright holder,
  author, license, library, version, and build. We recommend
  transporting <span class="glow">glo</span> shader libraries in
  the <a class="glow" href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/#glom">glom</a>
  manifest format which provides an ordered, named, hierarchical JSON
  structure around each
  <span class="glow">glo</span>
  object. The <span class="glow">glom</span> format
  and <span class="glow">glol</span> algorithm are flexible enough to
  provide storage and transport for arbitrary application-specific JSON objects in a
  well-defined order.
</p>
<p>Finally, the generated <span class="glow">glo</span> files may be
  linked back into valid shader programs
  by <span class="glow">gloc</span> or a simple JavaScript
  linker, <a href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/glol.js">glol.js</a>,
  included with <a href="https://github.com/ashima/gloc/">the
  distribution</a>. The linking algorithm takes a list of symbols to be
  satisfied (['main'] by default) and a search path
  of <span class="glow">glo</span> resources to use in shader
  construction.
</p>
<h3>Where <span class="glow">gloc</span> lives:</h3>
<p>The source code for the <a class="glow"
  href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/">gloc</a> suite version 1.0.0 has
  been released under the BSD 3-Clause license
  on <a href="https://github.com/ashima/gloc/">GitHub</a>. A <a href="http://ashimaarts.com/gloc/glocode/">Web
  interface</a> is immediately available.
</p>
<p>We heartily welcome community contributions and look forward to
  working with the WebGL, OCaml, and WWW communities to build precision
  tools for WebGL authors. Subscribe to the <a href="http://blog.ashimagroup.net/category/ashimaarts/feed/">RSS feed</a> of this blog or
